  Recycle Buddy is an Android app designed to help make recycling easier. The app allows a user to quickly find whether an item is recyclable or not by either searching it up or taking a picture of the item's barcode. It also has an information page which provides information on nearby recycling centers. 
  
  The barcode scanner uses Google's Mobile Vision API to detect barcodes in images and return the UPC. This UPC can be used to identify the item scanned and whether or not it can be recycled.
